## Title of the Project
**Decentralized Medical Records Management System**

A secure and patient-centric medical records management system utilizing blockchain technology to enhance data security, control, and accessibility for healthcare users.

## About
The **Decentralized Medical Records Management System** aims to provide patients control over their healthcare data, leveraging the Ethereum blockchain and IPFS for secure and distributed data storage. Traditional centralized healthcare systems present significant challenges with data privacy, security, and accessibility. This project addresses these challenges by decentralizing data storage and enabling patients to manage permissions, ensuring data integrity and autonomy.

## Features
- Decentralized storage with blockchain for tamper-proof data management.
- IPFS integration for scalable and secure storage of medical records.
- Patient-managed permissions, enabling data privacy and security.
- High availability and accessibility of medical records without central authority.
- User-friendly frontend built with ReactJS, integrated with MetaMask for secure access.

## Requirements
* **Operating System**: 64-bit OS (Linux or Windows recommended for compatibility with Ethereum and IPFS nodes).
* **Development Environment**: Node.js (v14 or later) and Python 3.6+.
* **Blockchain Framework**: Ethereum (using Hardhat or Truffle for smart contract deployment).
* **Storage System**: IPFS for decentralized file storage.
* **Frontend**: ReactJS for building the interface, with MetaMask for blockchain interaction.
* **Blockchain Libraries**: Web3.js for Ethereum integration.
* **Additional Dependencies**: Includes OpenZeppelin for secure smart contracts, and axios for API interactions.
